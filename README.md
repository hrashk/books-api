## Building the app

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```
will compile the app, run the unit tests and produce an uber-jar in the target folder.

## Running with maven

The following command will run the app from the compiled sources.
You'll need a running postgres db as described in the next section.
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The following command will run a version of the application with a postgres db and a redis cache as a testcontainer.
It will have sample books in the db.
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:test-run
```

## Running from jar
You will need running postgres and redis instances that you can spin up with docker-compose.

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

You may stop the instance once you're finished.
```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down
```

Once postgres is up, run the app itself:

```bash
java -jar target/books-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Available commands

The rest api services manages books using a Redis cache for search results.
The app keeps a single copy of a book with the same title and author. It handles the add and update operations
cleverly so that the unique constraint is not violated, e.g. by modifying an existing book rather than creating
a new one. Similarly, the category names are kept unique. Refer to the javadoc and test cases for further details.

## Configuration

The app reads its configuration from the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file.
You may override any of the parameters from the command line using the `-D` flag,
